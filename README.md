# Week 3 Homework

This week, you'll modify a Rails app that can showcase three games.

## Requirements

Build a Rails application that can mimic or extend the functionality of these sites:

* http://www.cspp52553.com/rps
* http://www.cspp52553.com/poker
* http://www.cspp52553.com/dice

I should be able to use the equivalent URL structure in your app as starting points, i.e.

* http://localhost:3000/rps
* http://localhost:3000/poker
* http://localhost:3000/dice


## Remember these key ideas:

* Remember the RCAV recipe.
* Remember the HTTP methods that your routes can support.
